Still half-asleep, you open your eyes. Realizing that you aren't in your familiar dorm, you try
to recall what had happened...Slowly you begin to remember. It was Sunday evening and you had a 
major final exam coming up on Monday for you Object Oriented Programming Class. This was the exam 
that would either make or break your grades for this course. Being the model university student that 
you were, you didn't study for it until the night before. Exhausted after a long cram session, 
you fell asleep in Young Adults section and it is now way pass closing hours. Just your luck, 
your exam is starting in about an hour and if you don't get out of here in time, you're so screwed. 
Thankfully, you're still carrying your backpack but too bad there's nothing in it. The exit door is 
probably locked and you can't leave without the MasterKey to unlock it! Objective: Find the MasterKey(to leave)! 

All progress will be lost. Hope you had fun~ 

On the table next to you, you see Textbook 'Java Essentials'. You should probably take that.

Librarian Look - This is the old hag librarian's office.The only thing that stands out is the Key. Too bad it's not the MasterKey.

Librarian alt Look - Other than the mountains of paper everywhere, there's nothing here for you to see or take.

Comic Look - Currently, the only thing that stands out is one of your textbooks.
