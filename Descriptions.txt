Still half-asleep, you open your eyes. Realizing that you aren't in your familiar dorm, you try
to recall what had happened...Slowly you begin to remember. It was Sunday evening and you had a 
major final exam coming up on Monday for you Object Oriented Programming Class. This was the exam 
that would either make or break your grades for this course. Being the model university student that 
you were, you didn't study for it until the night before. Exhausted after a long cram session, 
you fell asleep in Young Adults section and it is now way pass closing hours. Just your luck, 
your exam is starting in about an hour and if you don't get out of here in time, you're so screwed. 
Thankfully, you're still carrying your backpack but too bad there's nothing in it. The exit door is 
probably locked and you can't leave without the MasterKey to unlock it! Objective: Find the MasterKey(to leave)! 

Your progress will be lost. Hope you had fun~
