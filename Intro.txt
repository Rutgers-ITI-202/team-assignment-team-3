Still half-asleep, you open your eyes. Realizing that you aren't in your familiar dorm, you try
to recall what had happened...Slowly you begin to remember. It was Sunday evening and you had a 
major final exam coming up on Monday. This was the exam that would either make or break your 
grades for this course. Being the model university student that you were, you didn't study for it
until the night before. Exhausted after a long cram session, you fell asleep in Young Adults section 
and it is now way pass closing hours. Just your luck, your exam is starting in about an hour and
if you don't get out of here in time, you're so screwed. Thankfully, you're still carrying your
backpack but too bad there's nothing in it. The exit door is probably locked and you can't leave
without your wallet! Objective: Find the MasterKey(to leave) and your Wallet(to pay for the Uber)!
