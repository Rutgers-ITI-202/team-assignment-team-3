Still half-asleep, you open your eyes. Realizing that you aren't in your familiar dorm, you try
to recall what had happened...Slowly you begin to remember. It was Sunday evening and you had a 
major final exam coming up on Monday for Object Oriented Programming. This was the exam that would 
either make or break your grades for this course. Being the model university student that you were, 
you didn't study for it until the night before. Exhausted after a long cram session, you fell 
asleep in Young Adults section and it is now way pass closing hours. Just your luck, your exam is 
starting in about an hour and if you don't get out of here in time, you're so screwed. 
Thankfully, you're still carrying your backpack but too bad there's nothing in it. The exit door 
is probably locked and you can't leave without your wallet! Objective: Find the MasterKey(to leave) 
and your Wallet(to pay for the Uber)!
