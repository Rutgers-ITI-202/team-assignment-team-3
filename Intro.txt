Still half-asleep, you open your eyes. Realizing that you weren't in your familiar dorm, you try
to recall what had happened...Slowly you begin to remember. It was Sunday evening and you had a 
major final exam coming up on Monday. This was the exam that would either make or break your 
grades for this course. Being the model university student that you were, you didn't study for it
until the night before. Exhausted after a long cramming spree, you fell asleep in some corner at
the library after closing hours. Just your luck, your exam is about to start in about an hour and
if you don't get out of here in time, you're so screwed.
